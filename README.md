# Is your Birthday Lucky?
This fun app created using Vanilla JS that tells the user whether their birthday is lucky or not.

### How does the App work?

The user needs to do three things, namely:

1.Enter their birth date
2.Enter their lucky number
3. Click on the Check Button

As soon as the user does this, the App would display a message showing whether their birtday is lucky or not.

### How does the App decide that?
Basically, if the sum of digits in your birth date is divisible by your lucky number then the App would show that your birthday is lucky or else it would show unlucky. To learn more, check out the ABOUT section above.
